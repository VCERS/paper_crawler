The critical component in ASSLBs is the solid-state electrolyte. Among all solid-state electrolytes, the sulfide electrolytes have the highest ionic conductivity and favorable interface compatibility with sulfur-based cathodes. The ionic conductivity of sulfide electrolytes is comparable with or even higher than that of the commercial organic liquid electrolytes. However, several critical challenges for sulfide electrolytes still remain to be solved, including their narrow electrochemical stability window, the unstable interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes, as well as lithium dendrite formation in the electrolytes. Herein, the emerging sulfide electrolytes and preparation methods are reviewed. In particular, the required properties of the sulfide electrolytes, such as the electrochemical stabilities of the electrolytes and the compatible electrode/electrolyte interfaces are highlighted. The opportunities for sulfide-based ASSLBs are also discussed.","context":{"all":{"count":23507888,"mean":10.356783465551848,"rank":6262685,"pct":73,"higher_than":17215842},"journal":{"count":15091,"mean":11.094502551189445,"rank":5962,"pct":60,"higher_than":9114},"similar_age_3m":{"count":401520,"mean":17.926895307828715,"rank":133246,"pct":66,"higher_than":267728},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":270,"mean":15.471888888888888,"rank":102,"pct":62,"higher_than":168}},"authors":["Jinghua Wu","Sufu Liu","Fudong Han","Xiayin Yao","Chunsheng Wang"],"type":"article","handles":[],"pubdate":1612137600,"epubdate":1597708800,"dimensions_publication_id":"pub.1130183867","altmetric_id":88680363,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":4,"cited_by_tweeters_count":3,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":4,"last_updated":1665486869,"score":4.75,"history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.202000751","added_on":1598080219,"published_on":1597708800,"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":"0","mendeley":"266","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":266,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=5&types=ttttttww","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=5&types=ttttttww","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=5&types=ttttttww"},"details_url":"https://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=88680363"})
